<h2>use the latest, stable es6 features<a class="headerlink" href="#use-the-latest-stable-es6-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The code is now updated to the ECMA2015 standard, also known as ES6.
This allows for a much cleaner codebase as well as some nifty and logical updates
that were much needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="score-now-represents-an-actual-model">
<h2>score now represents an actual model<a class="headerlink" href="#score-now-represents-an-actual-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Score is now represented by an actual model… yes, ain’t nothin more to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="updated-getcsrf-to-use-the-new-api-endpoint">
<h2>updated getCSRF to use the new API endpoint<a class="headerlink" href="#updated-getcsrf-to-use-the-new-api-endpoint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>getCSRF was pretty flaky before because it had to receive the plug.dj landing page first
and then had to parse the token out of the head of the page. This was quite a bit of data
to be processed and understood by the function. Ever since plug.dj set out to make their
mobile client, they have an endpoint to receive the token. Obviously this was the perfect
opportunity to make use of it.
A thank you goes to <cite>Nodle &lt;https://github.com/Nodle&gt;</cite>. Who notified me about the endpoint
being available in #22</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="validateroomname-and-validateusername-return-the-sanitized-string-now-instead-of-an-object">
<h2>validateRoomName and validateUsername return the sanitized string now instead of an object<a class="headerlink" href="#validateroomname-and-validateusername-return-the-sanitized-string-now-instead-of-an-object" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>validateRoomName and validateUsername both returned an object which encapsuled the actual
string again. This was pretty useless since every developer who wanted to make use of that
function had to extract the string before using it. This is now a thing of the past.
To all developers using it, please remember to change that in your codebase, thank you!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="added-data-checks-to-grab-event">
<h2>added data checks to GRAB event<a class="headerlink" href="#added-data-checks-to-grab-event" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The grab event was parsed without many checks about the what and when, this also is fixed
with this version. So better behave, data. We are onto you!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="added-return-value-to-clearuserfromlists">
<h2>added return value to clearUserFromLists<a class="headerlink" href="#added-return-value-to-clearuserfromlists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>clearUserFromLists had no return value before, so you couldn’t know for sure whether the
user was cleared from the list or not. It was just a guess kind of thing. Now whenever the
user is found and cleared from the lists, the function will tell you so.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cachechat-now-returns-boolean-value-indicating-if-it-was-set">
<h2>cacheChat now returns boolean value indicating if it was set<a class="headerlink" href="#cachechat-now-returns-boolean-value-indicating-if-it-was-set" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Same goes for cacheChat, it returns its set value now, so you can save it if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flattened-the-response-of-activateplaylist-to-just-return-the-playlist-id">
<h2>flattened the response of activatePlaylist to just return the playlist ID<a class="headerlink" href="#flattened-the-response-of-activateplaylist-to-just-return-the-playlist-id" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Quite like validateRoomName and validateUsername and validateRoomName. Now returns the
plain number of the activated playlist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-all-models-to-use-unix-time-now">
<h2>refactored all models to use unix time now<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-all-models-to-use-unix-time-now" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This was done before, but not for all models. Plug has some really awkward way of
representing the current time. <cite>schrobby &lt;https://github.com/schrobby&gt;</cite> and I fixed that
early in development. Now all models used in plugged that hold a date or time will
give you the proper unix representation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-connectsocket">
<h2>refactored _connectSocket<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-connectsocket" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>connectSocket was kind of messy. I would like to write more about it but that’s pretty
much it. It is cleaner now, everybody likes neat, clean stuff am I right? right.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-login">
<h2>refactored login<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-login" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Login was kind of messy for others to read and open source is all about fun, contribution
and openness. I want to appeal to a lot of people who want to dive into making their room
a special place on plug.dj. So making it easy for people to know how the interface they
want to use works, is one of the uppermost priorities of this project. This is why the
refactor was long overdue. I hope this makes it a bit more readable for everybody.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-keepalive-as-well-to-better-suit-everyone-s-needs">
<h2>refactored keepAlive as well to better suit everyone’s needs<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-keepalive-as-well-to-better-suit-everyone-s-needs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>keepAlive was not as much of a problem of readability but much more of the way it was
handled. It had a lot of magic values and fixed constants to work. This is now all
customizable if wanted by the following functions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>setMaxTimeout</li>
<li>getMaxTimeout</li>
<li>setHeartbeatRate</li>
<li>getHeartbeatRate</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Otherwise the default max timeout is 60 seconds and the heartbeat rate is 20 seconds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-log">
<h2>refactored log<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-log" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Log was kind of off putting. It didn’t really fit in, it was kind of an early development
thing that was carried around for longer than it should. This is why the logger got
pulled completely and the log function internally got refactored.
You can just invoke your own logger and set the verbosity needed for your application now.
Everything else is done internally and you’ll get notified whether the verbosity is
satisfied.
I hope that makes life easier for everybody!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-wsaprocessor-and-renamed-to-eventprocessor">
<h2>refactored _wsaprocessor and renamed to _eventProcessor<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-wsaprocessor-and-renamed-to-eventprocessor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>_connectSocket was a huge switch statement which did hold all websocket events before.
Now, with some javascript object “trickery” and the _call_ function, this has been reduced
to a mere couple of lines. The work to be done on the event is now outsourced into
functions which reside in events.js</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-chat-into-an-object">
<h2>refactored chat into an object<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-chat-into-an-object" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All chat related functionality was directly added to the Plugged class. To group things
up a bit and make it easier to read I put every chat related member into an object
literal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-the-removechatmessage-functions">
<h2>refactored the removeChatMessage* functions<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-the-removechatmessage-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The removeChatMessage* functions were a bit messy and all over the place, now they share
the important parts and use a comparator function instead. If this goes on I should just
call 3.0 “Squeaky clean” but then again we don’t want to go down that road of naming major
releases, do we?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-query-to-hold-all-options-in-an-object">
<h2>refactored query to hold all options in an object<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-query-to-hold-all-options-in-an-object" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Like with chat, but it is requests!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="refactored-all-tests-to-adapt-to-the-new-code">
<h2>refactored all tests to adapt to the new code<a class="headerlink" href="#refactored-all-tests-to-adapt-to-the-new-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Obligatory refactor of all tests</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixed-timing-bug-with-query-and-chat">
<h2>fixed timing bug with query and chat<a class="headerlink" href="#fixed-timing-bug-with-query-and-chat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Both query and chat had a bug which allowed to spam requests in a way that would trigger
the floodAPI event. It was enough to do request in recurring order without enough time
in between. This is now fixed and instead, the requests will be slowed down earlier, but
allow you to code your requests freely without having to check not to flood the API.
If this should in any case be a problem for someone’s program, please contact me, this
either needs to be adjusted then or a different fix must be found.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixed-bug-in-requestself">
<h2>fixed bug in requestSelf<a class="headerlink" href="#fixed-bug-in-requestself" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before, when requestSelf was called, the self object was updated with it as well, this
allowed for some inconsistencies on your account object when you are in a room while
calling it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-new-documentation-this-should-solve-a-lot-of-starter-issues">
<h2>a new documentation (This should solve a lot of starter issues)<a class="headerlink" href="#a-new-documentation-this-should-solve-a-lot-of-starter-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Oi, you are reading this right now mate. At long last, plugged gets a proper, not awfully
written, not hard to navigate and actual full documentation. Which is also included in the
code itself! So if you are using a neat editor like Visual Studio Code or any other which
allows for JSDoc to be parsed, you are good to go!</p>
<p>I hope this makes everyones lives easier.</p>
</div>

<h2>the previous model was added into the documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#the-previous-model-was-added-into-the-documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<div class="section" id="mapped-playlistcycle">
<h2>mapped PlaylistCycle<a class="headerlink" href="#mapped-playlistcycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PlaylistCycle was just passed as is from the websocket. Which was a no go in case plug.dj
changes the model. So now it gets mapped. hurray for standardized models!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mapped-levelup">

most of their code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="added-setmaxtimeout">
<h2>added setMaxTimeout<a class="headerlink" href="#added-setmaxtimeout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Similar to heartbeatRate, except that this sets how long plugged should wait before it
declares the websocket connection as lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="added-getmaxtimeout">
<h2>added getMaxTimeout<a class="headerlink" href="#added-getmaxtimeout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>See above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="added-clearheartbeat">
<h2>added _clearHeartbeat<a class="headerlink" href="#added-clearheartbeat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Clears the heartbeat. An internal function which gets used mostly by _clearState.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="removed-logger-from-the-package-since-it-served-its-purpose">
<h2>removed logger from the package since it served its purpose<a class="headerlink" href="#removed-logger-from-the-package-since-it-served-its-purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As describe earlier, logger is now gone. Please revert to using a different logging
library or write your own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="removed-joined-room-and-plug-error-were-removed-you-have-to-use-a-callback-now">
<h2>removed JOINED_ROOM and PLUG_ERROR were removed, you have to use a callback now<a class="headerlink" href="#removed-joined-room-and-plug-error-were-removed-you-have-to-use-a-callback-now" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is one of the most important changes for all plugged users out there!!!</p>
<p>In light of the situation and how it was implemented, it was kind of out of place for
what it did. almost as if unnecessary. Which is why it was removed. You now have to use
the callback to retrieve the result.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="removed-login-successfull-logout-successfull-login-error-and-logout-error">
<h2>removed LOGIN_SUCCESSFULL, LOGOUT_SUCCESSFULL, LOGIN_ERROR and LOGOUT_ERROR<a class="headerlink" href="#removed-login-successfull-logout-successfull-login-error-and-logout-error" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It showed over time that these events were mostly unnecessary and the more logical
thing was to use callbacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="removed-the-previous-waitlist-from-the-waitlist-event">
<h2>removed the previous waitlist from the waitlist event<a class="headerlink" href="#removed-the-previous-waitlist-from-the-waitlist-event" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I don’t know if someone really needed this but it was kind not really needed and it case
it actually was, you can probably implement it within seconds in your own program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="removed-insertmedia-function">
<h2>removed insertMedia function<a class="headerlink" href="#removed-insertmedia-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Also a function that was weirdly implemented and not needed at all.</p>
</div>
