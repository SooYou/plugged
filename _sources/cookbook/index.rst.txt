The cookbook is a definitive guide to Plugged and helps you to understand
its inner workings as well as best practices and how you can apply everything to
your project, all followed by ready to go code snippets for you to try and use.

.. note::

   This documentation is still pretty fresh and I sadly can't dedicate a lot
   of time to writing new samples every day, it'll fill over time and rest
   assured, I am still working on this project. Though, of course, everyone
   is welcome to contribute to the project and make it a better tool for
   everyone. Please consider reading the :doc:`contribution</contribute>` guide
   before contributing.

   :underline:`thanks`!
