Plugged |version| contribution guide
====================================


Plugged has actually a **two part** contribution guide, now hear me out before you
start to yawn! The two parts are for two different things, namely:

    1. How do I contribute code properly
    2. How do I contribute to the documentation properly


Not everyone is into 1, others are not into 2. It really depends on yourself
what you want to do but please, read the appropiate that suits your contribution
case first.

*Thanks*!

Rules
#####

The rules to contribute are simple:

Keep in style with the code.
----------------------------

This makes it easier for others to read the whole codebase
since otherwise they need to concentrate on the style of the
code more than what it actually does.

Make reasonable changes
-----------------------

The code should stay clean and mostly general. Plugged is a toolbox, not a chair. So
changes that would only make sense for one very particular thing that is not in the
general sense of what you want to do with plug and can't be used without context of
the program you are using it in should not end up in Plugged itself.

Have fun and be positive
------------------------

This one should be obvious. This is an open source effort, driven by people who do this
out of the love for programming and the idea of a platform. This means first and foremost
that everyone should have fun. Otherwise this turns into a job and a job without getting
paid is slavory.

Changes should be PR'd on the dev branch
----------------------------------------

Just to keep the master branch clean.

Don't be shy to open a PR or issue
----------------------------------

Without voice, there is no change. I appreciate every effort to make this project better
for everyone!
