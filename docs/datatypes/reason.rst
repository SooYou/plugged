Summary
-------

The Reason enumeration is used as a banreason as well as a mutereason. It
enumerates a couple of reasons as to why a user would be muted/banned from a
room.

   The chosen reason will also be shown to the user so it is good practice to
   choose the right one and not just use one over and over again.
