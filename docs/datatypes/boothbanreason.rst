BOOTHBANREASON
==============

Summary
-------

Other as in banreason and mutereason. boothbanreason enumerates a couple of reasons as to
why a user would be muted/banned from a booth. While it would have been great to use one
reason for all, it was not possible due to the encoding plug uses.

.. hint::

   The chosen reason will also be shown to the user so it is good practice to
   choose the right one and not just use one.


Enum
----

   1. SPAMMING
   2. VERBAL_ABUSE
   3. OFFENSIVE_VIDEOS
   4. INAPPROPIATE_GENRE
   5. NEGATIVE_ATTITUDE
